## 1. Introduction

The project comprises multiple packages as sub-projects, with dependencies between them. The monorepo structure is managed using Yarn and Lerna. The following sections provide a detailed breakdown of the project structure, technologies used, and the configuration of various tools and libraries to ensure consistency, quality, and automated workflows across the project.

## 2. Project Structure

### 2.1 Monorepo Setup

-   **Monorepo Management**: Yarn and Lerna are used to manage the monorepo, ensuring consistent dependency versions and streamlined project scripts across packages.
-   **Atomic Design**: Used to organize components into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.
-   **Node.js**: 18.17.1
-   **Yarn**: 1.22.10
-   **Lerna**: 7.3.0

### 2.2 Packages

-   **React Components Library (frontend/components/react-cmp-lib)**: A library of reusable React components with a custom build system using Rollup.
-   **Design System Playground (frontend/ds-playgrounds/\*)**: A playground for testing components, with a custom build using Parcel.
-   **Foundation (shared/foundation)**: A collection of utilities written in TypeScript, packaged separately.
-   **Storybook (frontend/ds-storybook)**: A separate package for documenting and visually testing components in isolation.
-   **Living Style Guide - Generic Styles (frontend/lsg-design-system)**: A collections of SCSS variables, mixins, and functions, and component styles packaged separately.

## 3. Technology Stack

-   **Front-end**: React.js, TypeScript, SCSS
    -   React.js - for building user interfaces and component-based architecture.
    -   TypeScript - for extended JavaScript functionality, string type checking, and code consistency - catch and fix type related error before runtime - sometimes that comes with the expense of having to define complex types.
-   **Testing**: Jest for unit testing, Storybook and Chromatic for visual testing.
-   **Linting and Formatting**: Prettier, ESLint, and Stylelint.
-   **Version Control**: Git, with Husky for git hooks, Commit Lint, and Commitzen for structured commit messages.

## 4. Development and Build Tools

-   **Component Development**: Storybook for developing and documenting components in an isolated environment.
-   **Build Systems**: Custom build setups using Rollup for the component library and Parcel for the playground.

## 5. Continuous Integration and Deployment

-   **GitHub Actions**: Set up to automate testing, building, and deployment workflows.
-   **Chromatic Deployment**: Automatic deployment to Chromatic for visual regression testing and Storybook hosting.

## 6. Testing and Quality Assurance

-   **Unit Testing**: Jest is used for unit testing components and utility functions.
-   **Visual Testing**: Storybook and Chromatic are used for visual testing of components.
-   **Linting and Formatting**: Prettier, ESLint, and Stylelint are configured to ensure code consistency and quality.

## 7. Version Control and Commit Conventions

-   **Git Hooks**: Husky is configured to enforce linting and testing before commits and pushes.
-   **Commit Conventions**: Commit Lint and Commitzen are used to ensure structured and meaningful commit messages.

## 8. Root Commands / Scripts

-   `npm install -g yarn` - install yarn globally
-   `yarn install` - install dependencies
-   `yarn build:dev` - build all packages for development
-   `yarn build:prod` - build all packages for production
-   `yarn test` - run all tests
-   `yarn lint` - run all linters
-   `yarn formats:check` - check all formats
-   `yarn formats:write` - fix all formats
-   `yarn start` - start and watch all packages in development mode
-   `yarn nx graph` - show dependency graph using NX
-   `yarn commit` - commit changes using Commitizen
-   `yarn lerna version` - bump version of all packages using Lerna

## 9. CSS Architecture Checklist

-   Organized - fixed code structure
-   No specificity issues
-   Atomic Design principles applied
-   Easy to understand (comments, variables, etc)
-   Reusable across teams / projects

## 10. Backlog

### Future Improvements or Ideas

-   [ ] implement semantic release
-   [ ] refactor CI build for better performance (use CI for better performance)
    -   [ ] lint, formats and test
        -   [ ] -   run locally on committing for development branches
        -   [ ] -   run in CI for master branch and on pull requests to release branches
    -   [ ] visual regression testing run locally on feature and bug branches and remote on develop branch

## Case Studies

### State Management with Context API

Both versions of your `CartContextProvider` in React serve to manage a shopping cart's state and provide that state along with some functions (`addItem`, `updateItemQuantity`) to components in your application. However, they use different state management approaches, each with its own advantages and trade-offs.

### Version 1: Using `useState`

-   **State Management:** This version uses the `useState` hook for state management. It's straightforward and easy to understand, especially for simpler state logic.
-   **State Updating:** It directly manipulates the state based on the given actions (adding an item, updating quantity). This is more intuitive for simple state updates.
-   **Best Suited For:** Smaller applications or components where state changes are minimal and not complex.

### Version 2: Using `useReducer`

-   **State Management:** This version uses the `useReducer` hook, which is more suited for complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.
-   **State Updating:** Actions and reducers handle state updates, making it more structured and predictable, especially beneficial for complex state logic.
-   **Dispatch Method:** Actions are dispatched rather than setting the state directly. This is helpful for debugging and logging state changes.
-   **Best Suited For:** Larger applications or components with complex state interactions or when the state logic might grow in complexity over time.

### Key Differences

1. **Complexity and Scalability:** `useReducer` provides more scalability and is better for managing complex state logic. `useState` is simpler and more straightforward for basic state management.
2. **Predictability:** `useReducer` makes state updates more predictable and organized, which is advantageous in large applications.
3. **Debugging:** With `useReducer`, it's easier to track dispatched actions, which can aid in debugging.

### Choice Depends on Use Case

-   If your application's state logic is simple and unlikely to become complex, the `useState` approach might be more suitable.
-   If you anticipate more complex interactions or the state logic becoming more intricate over time, or if you prefer a more structured approach to state management, `useReducer` would be the better choice.

Both are valid in the React ecosystem, and the choice largely depends on the specific needs and complexity of your application.
